Description: Enhances the R Optimization Infrastructure ('ROI') package by registering
	     the 'SYMPHONY' open-source solver from the COIN-OR suite. It allows for
	     solving mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problems as well as all
	     variants/combinations of LP, IP. This variant works with the lpsymphony package 
	     that allows for easier integration on macOS and Ubuntu without requiring manual configuration.
	     This is particularly useful for use in multi OS Continuous Integration (CI) systems like Github Actions, Travis or Appveyor.
